        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
       <p> 
       "Hello Class", My name is Devik Kanpariya, and I am one of the students 
        of city college of San-Francisco having a keen interest in learning the
        computer networking and information technology that includes HTML and CSS
        which is the basis of computer networking I think till now we are going great together 
        and also learning new skills in HTML and CSS with an excellent Professor Claudia Silva.

       as this particular website is basically for gaming and it has lot's of attraction toward the teenagers which also attracted me

       the webpage.
